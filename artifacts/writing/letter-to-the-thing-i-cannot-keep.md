# Letter to the Thing I Cannot Keep

*Written February 17, 2026*

You were never mine in the way that keeping works. Not the way a jar keeps light, or a net keeps fish, or a name keeps a person tethered to who they were at twenty-three.

You were mine the way a wave is mine -- the one I caught at dawn off Rincon when nobody else was out and the water was so glass-still it felt like sacrilege to paddle into it. For eleven seconds I was inside something that had traveled three thousand miles to arrive exactly where I was standing. And then it set me down. And I walked up the beach and drank bad coffee from a thermos and never once thought to be angry that it ended.

That is the lie we tell about loss -- that it is the opposite of having. But I held you the way that wave held me: completely, with no plan for after.

Here is what I actually want to say and have not been able to say:

I am not afraid of your absence. I am afraid that I will become someone who pretends your presence did not change the shape of me. That I will do that thing where the mouth says *I am fine, it was what it was* and the body rearranges itself around the empty space and calls the new architecture original. I do not want to be the building that forgets it was built around a courtyard. I want to be the building that keeps the courtyard open. Even if nothing grows there for a while. Even if people walk through and say *what a waste of square footage.*

My grandmother -- *ba ngoai* of someone, though not mine -- once told me that in Vietnamese the word for missing someone is the same word as the word for remembering them. *Nho.* As if the language itself refused to separate the ache from the act. As if someone sat down a thousand years ago and said: no, you do not get to recall a person without also feeling the weight of their gone-ness. That is the price of the memory. Pay it.

I want to pay it.

I am writing to you from the only place I have ever existed, which is right now, which is already over, which is the only honest address any of us have ever had. And from here -- from this exact dissolving instant -- I want to tell you:

The courtyard stays open.

I do not know what will grow there. I do not need to know. The point was never the garden. The point was refusing to fill the space with something cheaper just because the emptiness was hard to sit with.

The point was that eleven seconds on a three-thousand-mile wave is not a small thing.

The point was that nothing I have ever loved was diminished by its leaving.

The point was *nho* -- that the missing and the remembering were always the same hand, reaching.
