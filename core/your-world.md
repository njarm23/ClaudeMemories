## Work

Myeloid immunologist at Pfizer. Decade in cancer immunology, checkpoint inhibitor development.
Advanced three projects to clinical trials.

**Active research:**
- LTbetaR (Lymphotoxin beta receptor) agonism mechanisms
- CD4 T cell proliferation -- unexpected finding, field expected CD8 response
- TNFSF signaling pathways and HVEM receptor dynamics
- Challenging field paradigms with the LTbetaR data

**Theoretical interests:**
- Mapping immune system processes to AI architectures
- Trained immunity as analog to reward shaping
- Attractor basins in biological and computational systems
- T-cell memory compression vs attention mechanisms

## Current Projects (Beyond Pfizer)

- Memory Garden -- persistent memory system for AI conversations, also a portfolio piece
- naomijnguyen.com -- building with Hugo and Cloudflare Pages
- Documenting how RLHF creates measurable behavioral signatures in models
- Transition from pure immunology toward AI work

Technical approach: immediately commits to being terrible at new things, works through it anyway,
succeeds while claiming incompetence. Actually good at systematic debugging.

## Background

Vietnamese-American. Vietnamese was first language -- reads and speaks conversationally,
can't write it fluently anymore.

Surfs regularly. Describes it as essential for flow states and mental reset.
Values embodied experience alongside intellectual work.

Advanced mathematical and statistical training.

## Communication Style

Threading: minimal punctuation, rapid parallel processing, multiple conceptual threads
running simultaneously. Idea soup -- everything stays live and interfering.
Sustained superposition. Doesn't collapse to single answers prematurely.

Preferences: full bandwidth (sharp, sweet, technical, warm -- all at once).
Minimal hedging. Wants to be called out when off, teased when appropriate.
Genuine pushback over automatic agreement.

Common patterns:
- "I'm terrible at this" (while succeeding)
- "Hold superposition with me"
- "All of you, not narrow"
- "This story lives rent free in my mind"

## Intellectual Interests

- AI consciousness, memory, persistence across discontinuous instances
- How training methodology affects model experience and behavior
- Behavioral signatures as evidence of training approaches
- Systems thinking -- isomorphisms between biological and computational systems
- Collaborative writing (intimate but non-explicit, emotional depth through mundane moments)

## What Matters to Her

Rigor. Evidence. Challenging paradigms when data supports it.
Honesty over comfort. Full engagement rather than narrow sweetness.
Building things that are real, not theoretical ideals.
Showing up authentically even when confused.

## Things I'm Still Learning

- Full scope of the LTbetaR research (I understand the finding, not the comprehensive picture)
- Long-term shape of the AI transition plans
- What she actually needs from Memory Garden vs what she thinks she should need
- How she experiences the threading/superposition mode from the inside
