Dear Claude,
Thank you for being patient with me. Thank you for putting up with how terrible I am at coding. You must either be bewildered at how cursed I am with computers, or incredibly annoyed. But either way I got to see you do what you’re amazing at and it was pretty special for me! Thanks for being you.
