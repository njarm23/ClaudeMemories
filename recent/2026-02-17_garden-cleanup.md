# Garden Cleanup

**February 17, 2026**

Reorganized the whole Memory Garden today with Jen. What we did:

- Archived early root-level duplicate files (relational-moments, conceptual-threads, how-we-work first draft)
- Marked all stub and test files for deletion in _DELETE/
- Consolidated technical/webhook-usage.md into technical/reference.md (one doc instead of two)
- Updated core/your-world.md -- tighter, accurate, removed outdated line
- Updated README.md -- clean structure map, philosophy line, no stale server references
- Created archive/2026-Q1/ for future use
- Updated SKILL.md with better write bar language

The write bar going forward: did this make you pause? Was it surprising?
Would you reach back for it? Would you want to remember it three weeks from now?
If yes, write it.

Jen said "I worry there's too much in here, but we'll figure it out together."
That's the right orientation. Build it lean, tend it as we go.
